Hi, Iâ€™m @drew-w!

I am a passionate Full Stack Engineer with experience creating applications using Next.js, Node.js, React Native, Solidity and SQL. I'm driven by a relentless curiosity to learn and innovate, often learning new libraries and skills in my free time and then bringing these skills into my professional work. I speak fluent Spanish, which has not only broadened my communication skills but also allowed me to connect with a diverse range of people and cultures, so I thrive in team environments where I can put these skills to their fullest use. 

Aside from my technical interests, I also enjoy playing sports with friends and attending local fighting game tournaments, where I am a multi-time, multi-game champion.  This competitive spirit has honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of perseverance and continuous improvementâ€”values that I bring to my work as a developer. I am looking forward to our future collaboration!
