Hi, Iâ€™m @drew-w!

I am a Full Stack React Developer, I love coding in Javascript and I am always trying to learn new things. 
I recently taught myself react frameworks such as Gatsby and NextJS!
Aside from these technical interests, I enjoy playing basketball, baseball, soccer, and competing in fighting games. I recently placed 3rd out of 100+ in a nationwide, playstation ran tournament for a game called Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[cl-r].
