Hi, Iâ€™m @drew-w!

I am a Full Stack Developer who excels in problem solving and thrives off of self improvement. I am able to efficiently write clean and effective code. Although I have experience creating endpoints querying a SQL database with Prisma, I excel at creating clean front end code and am used to working closely with UX/Graphic designers to bring their artistic vision to life. Aside from these technical interests, I enjoy playing basketball, disc golf, and competing in fighting games.
